# Overview
We aim develop an open source healthcare developer platform (SOC2, EU GDPR and ISO 27001 certified) that helps build, test, and deliver animal healthcare products such as telemedicine websites (and mobile applications) and practice information management systems in a click. The project objectives are:
- **Convenience for Pet Owners**: Schedule appointments, conduct consultations, manage pet health information, and access resources - all from a user-friendly mobile app. Improved
- **Accessibility**: Provide pet owners with access to veterinary care, especially in remote locations or for those with limited mobility.
- **Enhanced Efficiency:** Streamline appointment scheduling and communication between pet owners and veterinarians.
- **Expanding Veterinary Care Options:** Public APIs and MVP templates empower developers to-create innovative applications that extend the reach of Yosemite Crew and provide pet owners with even more choices for managing their pets' health.
- **Simple UI:** Our PIMS will prioritize user-friendliness and simplicity, avoiding the complexity of many existing systems.
- **Enhance customization:** We will offer an open-source solution, providing more flexibility and customization potential to meet the specific needs of different clinics.
- **Easy to integrate:** Our system will be easy to deploy and integrate with existing systems, reducing the barriers to adoption.
- **No locking:** We will not lock clinics into a subscription model, providing more flexibility in terms of pricing and usage.
- **Privacy and security first:** Our PIMS will include robust data management and reporting capabilities to help clinics make informed decisions.
- **Regular support:** We will provide ongoing support and updates to ensure the system remains effective and up-to-date.
- **Community building:** We will encourage community contributions to continuously improve and expand the system.
- **Compliant:** We will ensure our PIMS is compliant with all relevant regulatory standards to ensure data security and privacy.
- **Scalable:** We will make our system scalable to support the growth of veterinary clinics.
